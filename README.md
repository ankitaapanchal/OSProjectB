The program will execute and perform the following steps:
Display a request for user input.
Handle backspace for erasing characters during input.
Display the entered line.
Simulate reading data from a disk sector and display it.
Show a closing message.

During execution, keep an eye out for error messages. If the program performs the above steps without errors, it is functioning correctly. To verify the code, you need to compile it using ./compileOS.sh and if it has done successfully then run the simulator to check output.
